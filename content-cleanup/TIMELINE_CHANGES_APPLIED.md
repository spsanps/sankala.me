## Notes for Future Edits

### Image Adjustments Requested (not yet done):
1. **UCSD start image** - Crop to keep library, remove lower part
2. **TI image** - Zoom out more to get background
3. **eBay intern image** - Get the eBay logo visible

These image edits would need to be done in an image editor and then replaced in the `/public/images/` folders.

## What's Still TODO:

- Crop/edit images as requested above
- Add post-mortem note for StartR accelerator (when ready)
- Any other content refinements you notice while reviewing the live site

# How to Edit

1. Edit any field directly in this file
2. For colors, use hex codes (like `#8A9A85`) or Tailwind color names (like `gray-400`)
3. For images, use `(none)` if there's no image, or provide the path like `/images/path/to/image.jpg`
4. For links, add them in the format: `Label: URL` or write `(none)` if there are no links
5. Save this file and let me know - I'll update the code to match your edits

# Notes on Side Alternation

- Even index (0, 2, 4, 6) = RIGHT side (date on left, content on right)
- Odd index (1, 3, 5, 7) = LEFT side (content on left, date on right)
- This alternation is now **automatic** - you don't need to worry about it!

- all reference links should be in situ as well as in can be clicked from within the text.
- Introduction Header is missing.
- Numbering should restart at 1 for each section.
- Why the Scaling Belivers -> Why Scaling Believers
-  The robot that folds your laundry will be powered by a version of GPT-7. GPT-7 (GPT 7 repated twice with hover on second instance)
- wine gif should come above Consider what a video ..
- The same applies to touch, temperature, and force. -> The same applies to other modalities like touch, temperature, and force. 
- Pyramid is broken and not actually a pyramid - , associated text is clipped by sidebar.
- 32% → 62% Performance on novel concepts with same robot data, just better pretraining (idk what this was or means - seems visually broken)
 -Physical Intelligence (December 2024) -> Physical Intelligence (December 2025)
 - ←The frontier moves here what does this mean? is not clear
 - Logan Kilpatrick (Google Gemini API) -> Logan Kilpatrick (Google Gemini)
 - OpenAI: Restarted robotics team (2024), invested in Figure, 1X, Physical Intelligence | also they are now hiring for world models -> robtics world models
 - B image should be under B3: VIKI
 - This objection deserves serious examination. But it doesn't survive scrutiny. --> weak sentence, consider reworking to something very simple like "but: " and let the arguments speak for themselves
- Remove: Your spinal system doesn't understand coffee cups. It tracks trajectories your brain commanded.
- BRAIN (4-5 Hz)
Cloud / High-level planning
"Decide to grab cup"
↓
"Adjust for position" → "Close grip"
SPINAL CORD (200 Hz)
On-device / Trajectory tracking
Continuous trajectory tracking
Balance corrections
Reflexes & safety stops
This maps to Cloud (planning) vs On-device (control) : fact check the hz numbers and changing to less specific and just convey the idea
- Cloud robotics is less demanding than gaming: -> For instance, cloud robotics is less demanding than gaming:
- These are distribution plays, not science projects. -> These are distribution plays.
- Unitree humanoid pricing trajectory 2023-2025 (log scale) is overlapping, with figure text
- Remove: Assembly time	20-30 hours	5-10 hours
- Component figure now is 2025 not 2024
- The humanoid isn't pioneering manufacturing—it's assembling existing commodities in a new configuration. Remove

80%+ share -- these aren't in the same unit , same time frame . find the correct numbers and fix time period (multiplier or something or normalized)
- Here's what analyses miss: humanoids are easier than EVs. -> But humanoids are easier than EVs. (you see the general pattern of my corrections here - less baity statements, see if you can find more like this and report them all)
-Every major component is on a steep cost curve driven by other industries -> make hover effects for infographics (maybe more bolded text or something on hover)
-  The humanoid isn't pioneering manufacturing—it's assembling existing commodities in a new configuration. -> remove
- make sure GEI full form to short form is on first use
- image: A vision of general-purpose robot assistance ; add this is Robbie from I Robot with Glora
- ~$500-2,000/year	~$300-1,000/year -> remove current estiamte for cloud inference as we don't have it today. and just remove today's cost estimate since there is nothing to estimate against
- ← Captures via integration, ← Captures value via API fees why the arrow?, also the yellow block (integration model) should be full size to align with the length of the platform model
- —real capabilities, not vaporware. -- remove
